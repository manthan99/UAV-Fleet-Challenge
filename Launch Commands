# First visualise the SIP's
python /home/shrey/catkin_ws/src/UAV_Fleet_Challenge/swarm_search/src/ground_station_vis.py
# To navigate to SIP
python /home/shrey/catkin_ws/src/UAV_Fleet_Challenge/swarm_search/src/ground_station_ros.py

Sanity checks:
1. Once ./drone*.sh launched in odroid check if data comes properly in master. Error may be because of ACM 0/99. Check ls /dev/ttyACM
2. 

Changes:  
1. pluma ardupilot_ws/src/UAV_Fleet_Challenge/swarm_search/src/master_drone1.cpp --- Added guided things
2. apm*.launch check for port even if rostopic list works it might be possible its not the correct port
3. ensure rostopic echo /drone*/mavros/global_position/global --- GPS data coming properly
4. etc/hosts should have static ip of masters


ground_station_ros:
state1 - uptill publishing target SIP for all the drones
state2 -
