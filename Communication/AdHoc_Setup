# Wi-Fi Ad-hoc Setup (Ubuntu 16.04/18.04)

Ad-Hoc Mode in Wi-fi allows peer-to-peer communication between nodes in a network, 
without the need of any fixed infrastructure like routers and access-points.
this is essential for a decentralised swarm where no individual node/computer can cause failure of the whole system.

VIMP: Not all USB Wifi adapters support Wifi Adhoc. Check the manufacturer datasheet to verify AdHoc support.

Ad-Hoc mode is setup through the following instructions:

1. Configure wireless interface by adding/modifying the following lines to /etc/networks/interfaces. 
It is a good practice to make a backup of the original interfaces file and store ad-hoc settings in a separate file.

	sudo cp /etc/network/interfaces /etc/networks/interfaces.orig
	sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces.mesh

Add these lines. Keep the all the parameters same except the address parameter on all devices. 
Use the correct interface names which can be found by running 'ifconfig'
IP address given to the Ad-Hoc interface of each Mesh-Networking device must belong to the same subnet.

# interfaces(5) file used by ifup(8) and ifdown(8)
# Include files from /etc/network/interfaces.d:
source-directory /etc/network/interfaces.d

auto lo
iface lo inet loopback
iface enp3s0 inet dhcp
auto wlan0
# wlan0 is the name of the Wireless Interface. For laptops, it can be found from ifconfig listing.
iface wlan0 inet static
  address 192.168.19.101
  netmask 255.255.255.0
  wireless-channel 1
  wireless-essid MeshX
  wireless-mode ad-hoc

2. Restart the device
  sudo reboot now

3. Now the device is in Ad-Hoc mode. It cannot be reached by deviced connected to local Wi-Fi routers.
It can now only be accessed by devices having the same Ad-hoc settings as this device. 

Having same Cell-ID is very important for two devices to be able to reach other.
Cell-ID can be seen by running:

  iwconfig

4. To Be Added: To Hard Code Cell-Id
