# OLSR-Mesh setup on Ubuntu devices (Laptop/ODroid)

Configuration of mesh networks comprises of two major steps:
a. Configuring wireless interface into Ad-Hoc mode (Dealt with separately in AdHoc Setup File)
b. Setup of a daemon to handle routing (olsrd)

There are many mesh routing protocols like BATMAN, OLSR. Setting up OLSRD is the easiest and offers many parameters to tweak.
The RFC of OLSRD can be read to understand the underlying algorithms: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3626
Properties of OLSRD can be tweaked by modifying 
	/etc/olsrd/olsrd.conf

1. Setup Ad-Hoc mode by referring to 'AdHoc Setup'
2. Install olsrd
  sudo apt-get install olsrd 
3. Start OLSRD
	sudo olsrd -i wlan0 -d 1
  # wlp2s0 on laptop
  
The -d tag specifies the debugging level[0-9]. '0' means the program runs in the background.
Configure, reboot and run olsrd in all of the ODroids/Laptops that need to be connected to this network.

Without olsrd being started, the devices are able to ping each other.
Olsrd only makes the devices aware of the multiple paths existing between them and helps then utilise the links efficiently.
